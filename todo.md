# Making this blog great
This blog is currently a pretty bare bones install of the most excellent [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). However, as a plaything and hopefully a useful resource to others my objective is to:

* Install a decent theme (possibly from [http://jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org))
* Support a tags and category page, including a tag cloud
* Install an archive tree
* Integrate [my twitter feed](https://twitter.com/yatesco)
* **DONE** Integrate [Diqcus](https://disqus.com)
* Integrate this into my emacs workflow
* Automatically generate a sitemap.xml
