* Still ill
This head cold sucks and nothing is seeming to shift it.

However, I thought I would do some more blogging and see if I can get my emacs->blog workflow underway, and the answer is yes - woot!

/(drum roll...)/

This post was written entirely in =org-mode= with a [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/Yasnippet][yasnippet]] for the header:

I've got to stop as I have already spent too much time [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving][yak shaving]] and messing up:

#+BEGIN_HTML
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">that feeling of deleting the wrong directory and associated buffers for uncommitted files. I shouldn&#39;t work with a head-cold. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fail?src=hash">#fail</a></p>&mdash; Colin Yates (@yatesco) <a href="https://twitter.com/yatesco/status/638337979640057856">August 31, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

When I can think straight I will publish more.
