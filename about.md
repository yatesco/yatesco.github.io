# Welcome
Hi there, and come on in!

# Who?
Colin Yates is a professional Software Engineer with over 20 years experience both learning how (and just as often _how not_) to build software in a professional way.

# What?

This blog will be primarily technically focused, but may occasionally cover other subjects. In particular:

* Software Engineering (process, tooling, coding etc.)
* Christianity
* Family
* Whatever else springs to my disorganised mind

# Why?

Well, only you can answer _why_ you are here, but I hope you find something interesting. For me, I am doing this to expose my inner thoughts for scrutiny in the name of personal growth!

# Next?
Check out [my cunning plan for this blog.](/todo)
